# Self made libraries for F#
## Collection
will when finish have several collection type implementaiton, where some may be more for a exploratory creation like the 
List.fs which contains a List type represented as functions.

## LexPars 
Is when done a fullfletch lexer and parser generator capable of creating lexers as both a regex machine, NFA and DFA
where the last one will be able to both be represented as a jump table, compressed jumptable and a linked list representation, depending on user input. The parser will be a LR(1) parser, all with full perstistence structure in mind. This implementation will not need to auto write a .fs file to be compiled but will return functions directly without intermedia code generation. 

Not yet done.
